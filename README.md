# solo-react
The `React.js` portion of SOLO's engineering exam.


My submission was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses `SASS` as a CSS pre-processor for easier-to-read style.

## Getting Started
To run the React app in `development mode`:

    npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


To `build` the app for `production`:

    npm run build

This builds the app to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
